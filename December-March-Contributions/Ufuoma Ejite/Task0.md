# Getting Started with Open-Source Contribution

Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am **Ufuoma Ejite** from Nigeria. I am a graduate of Human Physiology. 
I am passionate about the intersection of Health and AI, hence my interest in this project. <br>

Building a Telemedicine app helps us to deliver care from our various locations. This is very satisfying, as a lot of persons would gain free access to healthcare 
via technology.

I have performed the main activities for this task, which include:
* Creating a GitHub account
* Going through the documentations on basic knowledge on how to use, write and contribute on GitHub
* Using the acquired knowledge from the above step to contibute to this task

I have learned about:
* Formatting a GitHub markdown
* Forking a repository
* Cloning a repository
* Writing a great Pull Request
* Writing meaningful commit messages <br>

and many other concepts.

I am very excited contributing to Mboalab's digital stethoscope app project. I appreciate the 
good work Mboalab does for the global community.

This is indeed an awesome experience!
