# **STEP BY STEP METHODOLOGY TO DEVELOPING THE DIGITAL STETHOSCOPE APP**

First of all, it is important to note that I suggest the use of **AGILE METHODOLOGY** for this mobile app development. Agile Methodology is the incremental and iterative mobile application development approach, where the complete app development process cycle is divided into multiple sub-modules, considered as mini-projects. Every submodule is assigned to an individual team and subjected to the complete development cycle, right from designing to development, testing, and delivery. The benefits of the agile methodology are: 
Faster development, reduced risks, better quality, seamless project management, enhanced customer experience, low cost of development, customization, higher ROI, and an early market reach. 

## **LIST OF TASKS AND DESCRIPTIONS**
1. **STRATEGY**: In this period, we are expected to define the main purpose of our app, identify our app's target audience, and establish our app's goals and objectives. It is important to review the plans for the app's investment and marketing.
2. **ANALYSIS AND PLANNING**: By this phase, we have a clear idea on what we are doing and we can start defining use cases and capturing detailed functional requirements. We  will also come up with a PRODUCT ROADMAP where we will be prioritising the mobile app requirements and grouping them into delivery milestones.
3. **MARKET RESEARCH**: This is particularly focused on understanding exactly how the users want this product to be. We will be running a market research to establish the shortcomings of existing appls like ours and focus on making ours better. We will be organizing a User research to create amazing user experiences to make our app interactive, intuitive and user-friendly.
4. **DESIGN**: This phase is broken into two; the software design and the hardware design. While the software design is being worked on, the hardware can be designed in order to be ready when the software design is ready. The hardware components include the Microphone (plug-in) and the sthetoscope while the hand and fabrication tools include a pair of scissors and free fall. From this phase, we expect to get: an information architecture, a user flow, wireframes, low & high fidelity designs, and interactive prototypes. Adobe Figma can be used for the design phase.
5. **DEVELOPMENT**: Here, we define the technical architecture, choose a tech stack and define the development milestones. For the frontend development of this app, Flutter or dart and Android studio will be used while for the backend development, python will be used. The TensorFlow, TensorBoard and Google cloud will be used for the Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence needs.
6. **APP TESTING**: Apps are stable, usable and secure when they have gone through thorough QA testing during the development. In this phase, the app will go through the User experience testing, functional testing, performance testing, device and platform testing, and security testing.
7. **DEPLOYMENT AND SUPPORT**: We will be using Google Play for deployment since it is an android app.
