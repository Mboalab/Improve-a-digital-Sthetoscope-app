# Task 1: Designing a Logo for the Project

## Objective: 
The brand of a project is paramount to delivering the message about its value and goals.
A proper brand helps the project get the necessary support and make an impact on all the stages of the project life cycle.
A logo can quickly grab viewers’ attention and communicate the project’s core objectives and importance in an interesting way. 
Logos are a point of identification; they’re the symbol that external people use to recognize the project's unique brand and value. 
Because a good logo is a visual, aesthetically pleasing element, it triggers positive recall about the project that the name alone might not. 
A good logo can pique the public's interest and invite them to learn more about the project.
