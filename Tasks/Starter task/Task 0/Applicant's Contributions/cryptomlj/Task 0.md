#### üôé<200d>‚ôÇÔ∏è A little about myself

Hi, my name is Okpalaeze Melvin (MLJ), Building student from Federal University of Technology Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria. I've been passionate about tech and specifically coding since i was a child. I have always wanted to teach and solve problems in the world by leveraging on Tech.

I have always heard about open source but i had zero experience when it comes to contributing to open source. Open source has helped widen my mind and i have learnt alot from the research i have made so far. I am interested in adding value to Mboalab's projects by contrubutioning.

I am proud to be part of the outreachy community and I am looking forward to contribute to this project.
