### TASK 0: Introduction to the project

###### About company

Our approach focuses on the integration of local knowledge by centering the local community especially women.

##### What is Stethoscope?
The stethoscope is a medical device for auscultation, or listening to internal sounds of an animal or human body. It typically has a small disc-shaped resonator that is placed against the skin, and one or two tubes connected to two earpieces. A stethoscope can be used to listen to the sounds made by the heart, lungs or intestines, as well as blood flow in arteries and veins. In combination with a manual sphygmomanometer, it is commonly used when measuring blood pressure.

##### About digital Stethoscope app
Digital Stethoscope app helps to solve expensive Stethoscope problems in low- and middle-income countries.
The objective is to develop an android app using ML for sounds classification on open data  and that could display the pulse rate.

## TASK 0 COMPLETED
- I forked [Improve-a-digital-Sthetoscope-app](https://github.com/Mboalab/Improve-a-digital-Sthetoscope-app);
- Then I cloned [this repository](https://github.com/umiida/Improve-a-digital-Sthetoscope-app.git) to my Android studio;
- I created new branch, called  **starter_task** for Task 0 and Task 1;
- I created 3 files: .gitignore, Task 0 completed.md, Task 1 completed.md;
- The .gitignore file prevents to do not push the local projects settings to github.

###### Self Introduction
> Assalamu alaikum, I am **Umida Reimbaeva Aytbay qizi** from small rural place in Karakalpakstan, in Uzbekistan.
> This year I finished my bachelor degree in Software engineering, at the university of [TUIT Nukus branch](https://tatunf.uz/).
> Now I am an Android developer, I have been working in this field for nearly 2 years. I basically create apps using Kotlin.
> I am looking forward to being an intern and contributing to this project.

It is the first time that I am participating in an open source project, so everything is new for me.
I have been using github since 2020 to save my projects and if projects are in github you can locally change or delete  everything without fear.
While doing task 0, I learned how to write on Github, it is awesome.
