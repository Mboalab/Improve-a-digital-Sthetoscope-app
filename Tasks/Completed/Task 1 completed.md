## MBOALAB (Improving a digital stethoscope app)

### TASK 1: Designing a Logo for the Project

#### My conception for task 1
>Task 1 is about creating a logo for the project. I know app names and app logos are the most important things for a project. When I create a project, I usually change the app name and add a logo at the ending. Because my mind is changing during the process. 
>But now I am in another situation. I am participating in a medical app and the users are local people. We already have an app name, so the logo must be understandable for them.

I am not good at creating design, but I tried to do.
First, I drew my logo ideas on paper, you can see it in _sketch_ideas.jpg_. Then I selected the third one, you can see it _sketch_final.jpg_. I created a logo with Adobe Illustrator, **stethoscope_logo**, it is my first job.
