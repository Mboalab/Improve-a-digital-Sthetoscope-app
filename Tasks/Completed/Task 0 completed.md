### TASK 0: Introduction to the project

###### About company

Our approach focuses on the integration of local knowledge by centering the local community especially women.

##### What is Stethoscope?
The stethoscope is a medical device for auscultation, or listening to internal sounds of an animal or human body. It typically has a small disc-shaped resonator that is placed against the skin, and one or two tubes connected to two earpieces. A stethoscope can be used to listen to the sounds made by the heart, lungs or intestines, as well as blood flow in arteries and veins. In combination with a manual sphygmomanometer, it is commonly used when measuring blood pressure.

##### About digital Stethoscope app
Digital Stethoscope app helps to solve expensive Stethoscope problems in low- and middle-income countries.
The objective is to develop an android app using ML for sounds classification on open data  and that could display the pulse rate.

###### Self Introduction
> Assalamu alaikum, I am **Umida Reimbaeva Aytbay qizi** from small rural place in Karakalpakstan, in Uzbekistan.
> This year I finished my bachelor degree in Software engineering, at the university of [TUIT Nukus branch](https://tatunf.uz/).
> Now I am an Android developer, I have been working in this field for nearly 2 years. I basically create apps using Kotlin.
> I am looking forward to being an intern and contributing to this project.

It is the first time that I am participating in an open source project, so everything is new for me.
I have been using github since 2020 to save my projects and if projects are in github you can locally change or delete  everything without fear.
While doing task 0, I learned how to write on Github, it is awesome.
