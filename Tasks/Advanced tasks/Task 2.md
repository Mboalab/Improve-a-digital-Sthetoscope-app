# Task 2: Design of the app for the project 

## Objective: 
One of the ultimate goals of the project is to come up with a complete app for pulse rate for wide and easy adoption and use.

[Sthestapp](https://www.hackster.io/mixpose/digital-stethoscope-ai-1e0229) would be an Android mobile application designed to make smartphones
an affordable yet effective solution to this issue.
