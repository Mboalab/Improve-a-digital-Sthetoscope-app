# Task 2: Design an app for the project 

## Objective: 
One of the ultimate goals of the project is to come up with a complete app for pulse rate for wide and easy adoption and use.

[Sthestapp](https://www.hackster.io/mixpose/digital-stethoscope-ai-1e0229) would be an Android mobile application designed to make smartphones
an affordable yet effective solution to this issue.

The app would use AI in the backend for sound classification and also determines the pulse rate.

The objective of this task is to come up with and design a step-by-step methodology to develop a similar app keeping the same features and functionalities.

> ## **Note:** The focus of the task is just to design a methodology with a specific list of tasks and descriptions, including technical details and tools to be used, on the various steps involved in the development of an app following the proposed example in the link.  

## Tools and Skills: 
>**This task is addressed to applicants with interest in the area of data science, programming and coding, technical documentation, all interested applicants willing to contribute to the project, participants having skills in web and front-end development, and other deemed relevant competencies.**
