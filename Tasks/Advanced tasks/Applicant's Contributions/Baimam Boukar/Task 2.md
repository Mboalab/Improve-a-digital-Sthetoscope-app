### The focus point üéà

Digital stethoscopes are use in the **detection and amplification of sounds associated with various organs of the human body**. The Stethoscope is a medical instrument for listening to the action of someones heart or breathing. The Stethoscope is ideal to keep within a medical or first aid room.

### A problem worth to be solved üíß

**Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)** are the leading cause of death worldwide, according to the **WHO**(World Health Organization).
In 2019, an estimated **17.9 million** individuals died from CVDs, accounting for **32%** of all global deaths. Heart attacks and strokes were responsible for 85% of these deaths. Furthermore, **Over 75% of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries**. In addition, between 2017 and 2019, an estimated **34,700 persons** died from **lung cancer** in the United Kingdom.

However, **early detection** of these disorders can save lives: **That's where Digital sethoscopes come in**. 
Based on heartbeats, **stethoscopes can be used to detect CVDs early**. Sethoscopes are essential instruments for doctors. They utilize it to monitor their patients' health by diagnosing a variety of issues.
But because the covid-19 pandemic was so widespread, doctors were unable to diagnose all individuals.
Digital stethoscopes are primarily designed for doctors and can also be found now in **first aid kits**. **This demonstrates the value of having a digital stethoscope at home. The difficulty is that the typical price for these stethoscopes is around $250, which is out of reach for most people in developing countries.**

### The ultimate solution üî•

In 2022, the number of smartphone users in the world today is **6.648 Billion, which translates to 83.32%** of the world's population owning a smartphone. And it is increadibely growing in developping countries.
**That's why this project intends to develop an open source, low-cost and simple-to-use system made up of a digital stethoscope and a mobile app running on android that is inexpensive to all and can be easily distributed to everyone throughout the world, allowing doctors to treat more patients through telemedicine.**

### Solution Overview üéØ

The solution consists of **a mobile software that works on Android and iOS as well as a bespoke low-cost stetoscope that listens to the user's heart or lungs beats and sends the pulse to the mobile app, which monitors everything**. 

This solution can be accomplished by training a **Machine Learning model** to use **sound categorization so that patients can perform self-checkups at any time**, and when the AI finds possible symptoms, the audio data is collected for the patients to send to a doctor for further examination.

 **Every time a patient does a self-checkup, it is kept in this electronic medical record, allowing doctors to have a better understanding of his health state.**


### How does it align with UN SDGs? üìä 
This project aligns with the **SDGs(Sustainale Development Goals)** number 3, and 17. It will help **to reduce the number of people who die from cardiovascular and heart related diseases** , as well as the number of people who die from preventable hearth or lung diseases.


### A valuable impact üöÄ

The project intends to create an open source, low-cost, and simple-to-use digital stethoscope that is affordable to all and can be easily distributed to everyone throughout the world, allowing clinicians to treat more patients through telemedicine. **This will result in fewer individuals dying from cardiovascular diseases and other ailments, as well as fewer people dying from preventable heart or lung related diseases.**

### Project plan for the digital stethoscope app
The project can be divided into three main aspects: **Design**, **Development**, and **Testing**.
- **DESIGN**:
    - Design the app
    - API and database design
    - Design the stethoscope
- **DEVELOPMENT & TESTING**
    - **Front-end**
        This is basically the integration of the UI design. Flutter is the ultimate technology to use for this part.
    - **Machine Learning**
        This is the development of the AI model that will be used to classify the sound and detect the pulse rate. We will use Python & Tensorflow for this part.
    - **Back-end development**
        After developing the AI model, we will integrate it with the app. That's why we will deploy the model on Tensorflow Serving and use the API to communicate with the app through both gRPC as well as HTTPS inference endpoints.
    - **Testing**
        We will test the app and the stethoscope to ensure that everything is working as expected. This activity will be continuous throughout the development process.

- **TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION & BRANDING**
    - redaction of the technical documentation
    - redaction of user manual
    - conception of app's mockups and flyers
